This template defines the content to be implemented in the selected Issue Tracking System
of the project.


Problem status
--------------
[“open”, “in review”, “in implementation”, “closed”, “rejected”]

| (to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__initiate_monitor_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__close_pr`)

Problem submitter
-----------------
[Who is the reporter of the problem?]

(to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)

Problem description
-------------------
[What is the problem?]

| Determine the cause of the problem, if possible.
| Determine the impact of the problem, if possible.
| Is notification required due to determined impact on affected parties?

| (to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem supporting information
------------------------------
[How to reproduce the problem?]

| Add additional information, e.g.
| add which operational state the problem occurred?
| observations, screenshots, debug traces, etc.

[Error occurrence rate?]

| Select one [None | Single Event | Sporadic | Highly Intermittent | Reproducible]

| (to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem category
----------------
[Safety affected, Security affected]

Safety, Security: Additional qualifier to highlight, if safety or security is affected

* Problems relating to requirements, architecture, implementation or code found by user of the platform.
* Problems found by contributor based on component, feature or platform integration tests.
* Problems or gaps found by Quality Management activities as defined in the Quality Management Plan.

In addition to the category Safety affected, the ASIL classification may added in the
documentation, if applicable.

| (to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem classification
----------------------
[minor, major, critical, blocker]

Classify the problem severity

| Use **minor**, if the impact is not significant of the project

* The problem does not restrict usage of features in a significant manner

| Resolution may be scheduled to any planned future SW release

| Use **major**, if the impact does effect the quality of the project

* The problem can be solved with workarounds for affected features

| Resolution shall be scheduled to next planned future SW release

| Use **critical**, if the impact does not prohibit to use the project, but quality cannot be guaranteed

* The problem affects a complete feature, that they are partly or complete not behave as expected

| Resolution shall be scheduled to next planned future SW release or to a new planned intermediate release, if urgent resolution is required

| Use **blocker**, if the impact prohibits using the project

* The problem affects more than one feature, that they are partly or complete not behave as expected OR
* Safety or Security risks identified

| Resolution shall be provided upon availability

.. note::
  In case of doubt, a safety or security relevant problem shall always classified as **blocker**.

Determine if Urgent resolution is required? (yes, no, only valid for critical, blocker)

| (to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem affected version
------------------------
[What version of the release is affected?]

Document the version of the release where the problem was detected.

Add further versions, if applicable during analysis activities.

| (to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__create_pr`)
| (to be updated during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem analysis results
------------------------
[What is the problem analysis result? Accepted or Rejected?]

| Especially document rejection Reason, if applicable

(to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem stakeholder
-------------------
[What are the potential stakeholder to resolve the problem?]

Add affected features, if applicable

(to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem expected closure version
--------------------------------
[Version when the problem should be resolved]

[Milestone when the problem should be resolved]

(to be filled out during :need:`wf__problem__analyze_pr`)

Problem solutions
-----------------
[What are measures to solve the problem?]

Specify the measures to resolve the problem, based on a rationale

Verify the effectiveness of the implemented measure

Report the results of the verification, if applicable

Are all arguments convincing
