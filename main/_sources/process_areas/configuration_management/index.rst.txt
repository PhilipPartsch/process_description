========================

Configuration Management Tooling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Almost all requirements of the standards towards configuration management can be covered by
standard tooling of the Eclipse Foundation (github for versioning) and of the S-CORE project
(sphinx-needs for text based identification of work products).

For the automated storage additional tooling is created (see :doc:`guidance/configuration_process_req`)
