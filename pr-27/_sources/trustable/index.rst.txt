Trustable
=========


*The* `Trustable Software Framework (TSF) <https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/index.html>`_
*approach is designed for consideration of software where factors such as safety, security,
performance, availability and reliability are considered critical. Broadly we assert that any
consideration of trust must be based on evidence.*

You can copy the folder and use this as a template to measure your OSS project trust.
Link your evidences to the Trustable Assertions (TA) and update the content of the
Tenets and Assertions according your project and evidences.

Especially replace "XYZ" software or SW with the name of your project, e.g.
"This release of S-CORE is trustable".

    This release of XYZ is Trustable.

    Trustability of the release is based on aggregation of the evidence from all
    of the Trustable Tenets and Trustable Assertions.
    The algorithm for aggregation may involve weighting of specific Tenets or
    Assertions based on project priorities or experience.

The graphs below presents statistics:
